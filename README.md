# moolang-interpreter-go
Moolang interpreter written in go language.

Built based on [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) mainly and some other books. But I believe it'll have some difference and additional features.

*Note: Under construction. Not yet ready for experiment or use.*
